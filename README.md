 <h2>The porject is made up off these files:</h2>
    - main.c - Main file to execute all of our functions.<br>
    - my_stm32f4_gpio_driver.h - Define the designations and functions that will be called by the driver.<br>
    - my_stm32f4_uart_driver.h - Define UART designations and function.<br>
    - my_stm32f4_gpio_lib.h - Define the hardware we will be making use of.<br>
    - my_stm32f4_gpio_lib.c - Apply the functions.<br>
    - my_stm32f4_uart_lib.h - Define UART funtions for communication with the UART.<br>
    - my_stm32f4_uart_lib.c - Implementation of the UART funtions.<br>
